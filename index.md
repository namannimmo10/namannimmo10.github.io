# I'm Pradyun.

Hello!

I am an open source advocate, a software developer, and a generally curious person. I like to work on improving the experience of using software, for other humans.

If you'd like to know more about my projects, talks, and community involvement, you can read my portfolio of [stuff]. And, in case you came looking, here's my [email] and my [blog].

Currently, I am working [part-time on pip as part of donor funded work][pip-work]. I just finished my undergraduate course, and am doing a lot of paperwork for what-comes-next!
<small>Updated on 8th July, 2020.</small>

Feel free to reach out, if you'd like to chat. You can find me at a lot of places on the internet.
