# I'm Pradyun.

Hello!

I am an open source advocate, a software developer, and a generally curious person. I like to work on improving the experience of using software, for other humans.

I have a [blog]. I also maintain a list of [stuff] I've done. And, here's my [email] if that's what you're looking for.

Currently, I am working at [Bloomberg Engineering], as part of their Python Infrastructure team. <small>Updated on 6th Dec, 2020.</small>
