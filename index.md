# I'm Pradyun.

Hello!

I am an open source advocate, a polyglot software developer, a [Google Summer of Code 2017 Fellow][gsoc-2017] and in general, a curious person. I enjoy working on improving software systems so that they're more useful, for the humans using them.

Iâ€™m currently working on the tooling for packaging and installing Python based software and libraries; as a member of the [Python Packaging Authority][pypa] and a maintainer of [pip] and [virtualenv]. I am also in the [TOML] Core team.

I am a senior (4th) year undergraduate student (B.Tech. Computer Science and Engineering). I'm currently looking for 16 weeks internships to do in my final semester in college, that start in early December 2019.

You can find me at a lot of places on the internet. I sometimes write in [my blog]. Feel free to reach out, if you'd like to chat. I am available to chat over [email] and Twitter.
