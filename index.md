# I'm Pradyun.

Hello!

I am an open source advocate, a polyglot software developer, a [Google Summer of Code 2017 Fellow][gsoc-2017] and in general, a curious person. I enjoy working on improving the experience of using software, for other humans.

Iâ€™m currently working on the tooling for packaging and installing Python based software and libraries; as a member of the [Python Packaging Authority][pypa] and a maintainer of [pip] and [virtualenv]. I am also in the [TOML] Core team.

I am pursuing an undergraduate degree for Computer Science and Engineering in India. I am also part of the organizing team of the largest student-organized conference in my college, [Devspace].

You can find me at a lot of places on the internet. I sometimes write in [my blog]. Feel free to reach out, if you'd like to chat. I am available to chat over [email] and Twitter.
