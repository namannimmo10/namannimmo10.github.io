# I'm Pradyun.

Hello!

I am an open source advocate, a polyglot software developer, a Python Software Foundation Fellow, a [Google Summer of Code 2017 student][gsoc-2017] and in general, a curious person.

I enjoy working on improving software systems so that they're more useful, for the humans using them. Thus, I volunteer my time to work on tooling for packaging and installing Python based software and libraries; as a member of the [Python Packaging Authority][pypa] and a maintainer of [pip] and [virtualenv]. I am also in the [TOML] Core team.

I occasionally [blog].

I'm currently looking for 20+ week internships, for my final semester credits in college, starting in December 2019 or early January 2020. If you reckon I'd be a good addition to your team, please reach out.

You can find me at a lot of places on the internet. Feel free to reach out, if you'd like to chat. I am available to chat over [email] and Twitter.
